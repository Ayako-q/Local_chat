/*
Oleksii Ishchenko Project 2
This is my code
now I have only first 3 working functions
Sorry for late project and deviating from the task
But I believe that this code may show you my
understanding of inheritance in Java
I am going to finish all the functionality that
I've planned to add to this code later
